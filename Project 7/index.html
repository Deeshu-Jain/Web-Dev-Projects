    <h1>Welcome to Weight Metric Converter</h1>
    <h2>This project is made using HTML and JavaScript</h2>
    <p>We will take in a number in pounds(lbs) and convert it to kilograms(kgs).
       Right now we only know enough to do this one way, but later on we will learn
       how to add logic to sort this problem.
    </p>
    <p>In this project, the following has been established.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Using JavaScript, a number is inputted in pounds.</li>
        <li>Then the linked js file converts this number to kilograms(*0.454).</li>
        <li>Afterwards, the weight in kilograms is reported back in an alert.</li>
        <li>Then console has the following output "Conversion Completed".</li>
    </ul>
