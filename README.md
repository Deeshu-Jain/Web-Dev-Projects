# WEB DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS
Projects made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript


## Support My Work :wink:
You can feel free to comment on my projects, find the bugs :mag_right: or tell me what your thoughts about my coding, analysis and insight. You can also take some codes away if you think some of them can be useful for your projects :computer:. 
If you liked what you saw :blush:, want to have a chat with me about the portfolio, work opportunities, or collaboration, shoot :gun: an email at djjain844@gmail.com.

You can check out my portfolio here :v:.
